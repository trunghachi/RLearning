# Central Dogma

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It was first proposed by Francis Crick in 1958 and outlines the process by which genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA to protein. This flow of information is essential for the functioning of cells and the expression of genetic traits.

### Key Components of the Central Dogma

1. **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**:
   - The genetic material that stores all the information necessary for the structure and function of living organisms. It is composed of sequences of nucleotides, each containing a nitrogenous base (A, T, C, G), a deoxyribose sugar, and a phosphate group.

2. **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**:
   - Acts as an intermediate in transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins. RNA is also composed of nucleotides, but it has a ribose sugar and uses Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T).

3. **Protein**:
   - The final product of the gene expression process. Proteins are composed of amino acids and perform many functions within organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules.

### Processes in the Central Dogma

1. **Replication**:
   - The process by which DNA makes a copy of itself. This is essential for cell division, ensuring that each new cell receives an identical copy of the DNA. DNA replication involves the enzyme DNA polymerase, which synthesizes a new strand complementary to the original DNA strand.

2. **Transcription**:
   - The process by which the information in a specific region of DNA is copied into RNA. This involves the enzyme RNA polymerase, which synthesizes a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to the DNA template strand. The primary types of RNA produced are messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

   **Steps of Transcription**:
   - **Initiation**: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of the gene.
   - **Elongation**: RNA polymerase synthesizes the RNA strand by adding complementary nucleotides to the growing RNA molecule.
   - **Termination**: RNA polymerase reaches a terminator sequence, causing it to release the newly synthesized RNA strand.

3. **Translation**:
   - The process by which the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is decoded to synthesize a specific protein. This takes place in the ribosome, a complex molecular machine composed of rRNA and proteins.

   **Steps of Translation**:
   - **Initiation**: The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA near the start codon (AUG). The initiator tRNA, carrying the amino acid methionine, pairs with the start codon.
   - **Elongation**: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading codons and bringing in tRNAs carrying the appropriate amino acids. The amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a growing polypeptide chain.
   - **Termination**: When a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) is reached, the ribosome releases the completed polypeptide chain and the mRNA.
RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a versatile molecule that plays crucial roles in the expression and regulation of genetic information. There are several types of RNA, each with specific functions in the cell. Here are the main types of RNA:

## 1. Coding RNA or Messenger RNA (mRNA)
- **Function**: Carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis.
- **Structure**: Single-stranded molecule that includes a 5' cap, a 5' untranslated region (UTR), a coding sequence (open reading frame), a 3' UTR, and a poly-A tail.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Transcription (DNA to RNA) and Translation (RNA to Protein).

## 2. Non-coding RNA
### 1. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
- **Function**: Brings amino acids to the ribosome during translation. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that pairs with a complementary codon on the mRNA.
- **Structure**: Cloverleaf structure with an anticodon loop and an amino acid attachment site.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Translation (assists in assembling amino acids into proteins).

### 2. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
- **Function**: Forms the core of ribosomes, which are the molecular machines that synthesize proteins. rRNA catalyzes peptide bond formation and ensures proper alignment of mRNA and tRNA.
- **Structure**: rRNA molecules combine with proteins to form the large and small subunits of the ribosome.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Translation (structural and catalytic component of ribosomes).

### 3. Small Nuclear RNA (snRNA)
- **Function**: Involved in the processing of pre-mRNA (splicing). snRNAs are components of spliceosomes, which remove introns from pre-mRNA.
- **Structure**: Small RNA molecules (approximately 150 nucleotides long) that associate with proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).
- **Role in Central Dogma**: RNA processing (splicing of pre-mRNA).

### 4. Small Nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)
- **Function**: Involved in the chemical modification and processing of rRNA, tRNA, and snRNA. snoRNAs guide the modification of nucleotides in these RNA molecules.
- **Structure**: Small RNA molecules that localize to the nucleolus.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: RNA processing (modification of rRNA, tRNA, and snRNA).

### 5. MicroRNA (miRNA)
- **Function**: Regulates gene expression by binding to complementary sequences on target mRNAs, leading to their degradation or inhibition of translation.
- **Structure**: Small RNA molecules (about 22 nucleotides long).
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Post-transcriptional regulation (gene silencing).

### 6. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)
- **Function**: Involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a process that leads to the degradation of specific mRNAs, thereby silencing gene expression. siRNAs are often exogenous double-stranded RNA molecules that are processed into short fragments.
- **Structure**: Short double-stranded RNA molecules (about 20-25 nucleotides long).
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Post-transcriptional regulation (gene silencing).

### 7. Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA)
- **Function**: Regulates gene expression at various levels, including chromatin modification, transcription, and post-transcriptional processing. The functions of many lncRNAs are still being elucidated.
- **Structure**: Long RNA molecules (longer than 200 nucleotides) that do not code for proteins.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Regulation of gene expression (various roles).

### 8. Piwi-Interacting RNA (piRNA)
- **Function**: Protects the genome from transposable elements in germ cells by silencing transposons and other genetic elements.
- **Structure**: Small RNA molecules (24-31 nucleotides long) that interact with Piwi proteins.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Regulation of genome integrity (transposon silencing).

### 9. Circular RNA (circRNA)
- **Function**: Involved in the regulation of gene expression by acting as microRNA sponges, modulating transcription, and interacting with RNA-binding proteins. The functions of many circRNAs are still being studied.
- **Structure**: Covalently closed loop structures with no 5' or 3' ends.
- **Role in Central Dogma**: Regulation of gene expression (various roles).

### Summary

- **mRNA**: Template for protein synthesis.
- **tRNA**: Brings amino acids to ribosome.
- **rRNA**: Structural and catalytic component of ribosomes.
- **snRNA**: Involved in mRNA splicing.
- **snoRNA**: Guides chemical modification of other RNAs.
- **miRNA**: Regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally.
- **siRNA**: Silences genes through RNA interference.
- **lncRNA**: Diverse regulatory roles in gene expression.
- **piRNA**: Protects genome integrity in germ cells.
- **circRNA**: Regulates gene expression and interacts with other RNA molecules.

Understanding the different types of RNA and their functions is essential for studying gene expression, regulation, and the molecular mechanisms of life.
  
### Summary of the Central Dogma

- **DNA → RNA → Protein**: This is the unidirectional flow of genetic information.
  - **Replication**: DNA is copied to produce identical DNA molecules.
  - **Transcription**: DNA is transcribed into RNA.
  - **Translation**: RNA is translated into a protein.

### Exceptions and Extensions

While the central dogma describes the general flow of genetic information, there are some exceptions and additional layers of complexity:

1. **Reverse Transcription**:
   - Some viruses, like retroviruses, can reverse transcribe RNA into DNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA can then integrate into the host genome.

2. **RNA Processing**:
   - In eukaryotes, the primary RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes processing, including splicing, capping, and polyadenylation, before becoming mature mRNA.

3. **Non-coding RNAs**:
   - Not all RNA molecules encode proteins. Some, like tRNA, rRNA, and various regulatory RNAs (e.g., microRNAs), have structural or regulatory roles.

Understanding the central dogma is fundamental to molecular biology, genetics, and biotechnology, as it explains how genetic information is expressed and regulated within cells.

### Nucleotides

Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Each nucleotide is composed of three main components:

1. **Nitrogenous Base**: 
   - **Purines**: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G)
   - **Pyrimidines**: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) in DNA, and Uracil (U) in RNA

2. **Pentose Sugar**: 
   - **Deoxyribose** in DNA
   - **Ribose** in RNA

3. **Phosphate Group**: 
   - One or more phosphate groups attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar.

### Structure of a Nucleotide

- **Nitrogenous Base**: Attached to the 1' carbon of the sugar.
- **Pentose Sugar**: Forms the central part of the nucleotide.
- **Phosphate Group**: Attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar, forming the backbone of the nucleic acid strand through phosphodiester bonds.

### Types of Nucleotides

1. **DNA Nucleotides**:
   - **Deoxyadenosine Monophosphate (dAMP)**: Adenine + Deoxyribose + Phosphate
   - **Deoxycytidine Monophosphate (dCMP)**: Cytosine + Deoxyribose + Phosphate
   - **Deoxyguanosine Monophosphate (dGMP)**: Guanine + Deoxyribose + Phosphate
   - **Deoxythymidine Monophosphate (dTMP)**: Thymine + Deoxyribose + Phosphate

2. **RNA Nucleotides**:
   - **Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)**: Adenine + Ribose + Phosphate
   - **Cytidine Monophosphate (CMP)**: Cytosine + Ribose + Phosphate
   - **Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP)**: Guanine + Ribose + Phosphate
   - **Uridine Monophosphate (UMP)**: Uracil + Ribose + Phosphate

### Functions of Nucleotides

1. **Building Blocks of DNA and RNA**:
   - Nucleotides polymerize to form long chains (polynucleotides) through phosphodiester bonds between the 3' hydroxyl group of one nucleotide's sugar and the 5' phosphate group of the next.

2. **Energy Currency**:
   - ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate): A nucleotide that stores and transfers energy within cells.
   - GTP (Guanosine Triphosphate): Used in protein synthesis and signal transduction.

3. **Signaling Molecules**:
   - cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate): Acts as a second messenger in various signaling pathways.

4. **Coenzymes**:
   - NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), FAD (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide), and CoA (Coenzyme A) are nucleotides that act as cofactors in enzymatic reactions.

### Formation of Nucleic Acid Strands

1. **Phosphodiester Bond Formation**:
   - During DNA and RNA synthesis, nucleotides are joined by phosphodiester bonds. The 3' hydroxyl group of the sugar of one nucleotide bonds with the 5' phosphate group of the next nucleotide, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone.

2. **Directional Nature**:
   - Nucleic acid strands have a direction, designated as 5' to 3'. This refers to the orientation of the carbon atoms in the sugar molecule in the backbone.

3. **Complementary Base Pairing**:
   - DNA: Adenine pairs with Thymine (A-T), and Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G-C).
   - RNA: Adenine pairs with Uracil (A-U), and Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G-C).
