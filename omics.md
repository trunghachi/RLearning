# scRNAseq
## Single-cell sequencing
* **scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq - Transcriptomics**
* scATAC-seq/snATAC-seq - Chromatin accessibility
* CITE-seq - Surface protein expression
* AIRR - TCR/BCR profiling
* Spatial-seq - Spatial profiling of gene expression.
## Single-cell platforms
* **10x Genomics (microfluidics)** (the most used technologies, 10x is 3' biased so will not provide full length transcript coverage.
As 10x is sequencing only the 3' of transcripts/genes, less sequencing depth is required per transcript/gene)
* Smart-seq3 (microfluidics)
* Drop-seq (microfluidics)
* VASA-seq (FANS)
* inDrop-seq (microfluidics)
* In-house solutions
